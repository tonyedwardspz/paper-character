Material Design: <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html">Button</a>

`paper-character` is a floating action button. It contains one or two characters in the center and
comes in two sizes: regular size and a smaller size by applying the attribute `mini`. When
the user touches the button, a ripple effect emanates from the center of the button.

Example:

```html

<paper-character>1</paper-character>
<paper-character mini>A</paper-character>
<paper-character>&</paper-character>
```
